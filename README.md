# Weechat-plugins
Playing around with a couple of different ideas for weechat/wee-slack

## Collapse
It would be useful "collapse" messages from bots like github: Instead of printing out a ton of links, just tell me, which project, who, and what they said.

## Highlight
A highlighter were I can pass in strings I want to be alerted on

## Silent
Playing around with the idea of scilencing certain accounts (noisy bots)
